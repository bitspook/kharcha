⚠️ I am archiving this because fuck Apple. Twats won't allow me to run the app I build on my own phone more than a week without rebuild. I'll probably build a web version of this sometime soon.

* Kharcha

Kharcha is an iOS app which provides a UI for [[https://github.com/simonmichael/hledger][ledger]] file of my everyday
expenses.

** Objective

1. Provide insight into my expenses

   - Answer questions about things I have purchased in past. For example:
     - How has the price of <X> changed? e.g show a graph of price over time
     - What is the cheapest place I bought <X> from?
     - How much money has spent in <Y> store?
   - Help me to find and fix cognitive biases in my spending habits

2. Planning expenses

   - Help me plan things I want to purchase from where and when to purchase
     them
   - Help me answer questions like
     - Which store should I visit for purchasing everything in my list?

3. Optimize value for money

   - Optimize for getting maximum value for money spent
   - It should take into account the quality of things I buy when optimizing
     for price and not just pick the cheapest items. I don't want to save 20
     cents and get cancer instead.

4. Set and achieve hedonistic goals

   - Help me identify certain things as hedonistic and help me get them without
     putting a dent in my budget. For example it should help me squeeze a few
     pennies by shifting my spending habits a little bit and contribute to
     purchasing nice-to-have things

** Inspiration

I have recently relocated to Berlin. I am in that phase where everything seems
outrageously expensive, which make me very anxious. This app is one of my
attempts to channelize this anxiety into learning and building something useful.
